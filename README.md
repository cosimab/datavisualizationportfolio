# datavisualizationportfolio
This repository contains my portfolio submission for the Data Visualization module in the Data Science M.Sc. program at HAW Kiel. The core objective was to combine multiple datasets into a cohesive visual narrative. I chose to focus on differences between East and West Germany. My project is in German. 

Grade achieved: 100/100 points

* [`portfolio.ipynb`]: The Jupyter notebook in which I created the visualisations
* [`capstone.pdf`]: The final submission created with Canva, using the visualisations from the notebook
